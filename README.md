# Final_Year_Project


ðŸ“˜ README Highlights: Deep Learning-Based Cancer Detection System
ðŸ”„ Project Continuation
This project is a continuation of our previous work, the Treatment Recommendation System, which suggested appropriate drugs based on user-input symptoms. Now, we extend our efforts to automated cancer detection using deep learning.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To develop a deep learning-based system capable of detecting multiple types of cancer from medical images, enabling early diagnosis and supporting clinical decision-making.

ðŸ§  Deep Learning Techniques
Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other advanced architectures to learn complex patterns from large-scale medical imaging datasets.

ðŸ©º Cancer Types Covered

Cervical Cancer (Pap smear analysis)
Lung & Colon Cancer (CT & colonoscopy images)
Oral Cancer (histopathological images)
Kidney Cancer (MRI & ultrasound)
Breast Cancer (mammography & histopathology)
Brain Cancer (MRI & PET scans)
ðŸ“Š Imaging Modalities
The system supports a wide range of imaging formats, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and histopathology, ensuring versatility across diagnostic scenarios.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features

Accurate classification and segmentation of tumor regions
Early detection support
Integration-ready with treatment recommendation systems
Potential to reduce false negatives and improve diagnostic confidence
ðŸš€ Future Scope
The long-term goal is to integrate this detection system with the existing symptom-based drug recommendation engine, creating a comprehensive AI-powered diagnostic and treatment assistant.
